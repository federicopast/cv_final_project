<a name="Eileen-gray" class="anchor" href="#Eileen-gray"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kathleen Eileen Moray Gray  (1878 - 1976)</h3>

<p><img src="images/EileenGray.jpg" alt="Eileen gray image"></p>

<p>Gray was born as Katherine Eileen Moray Smith on 9 August 1878, near Enniscorthy, a market town in south-eastern Ireland. Her father, James McLaren Smith, was a painter who encouraged his daughter's artistic interests. Her mother was Eveleen Pounden, a granddaughter of the 10th Earl of Moray; she became the 19th Baroness Gray in 1895, upon the death of her own mother, née Lady Jane Stuart. After that, Lady Gray, who had separated from her husband in 1888, changed her children's surname to Gray.
In 1898, Gray attended classes at the Slade School of Fine Art, where she studied painting. While there, she met Jessie Gavin and Kathleen Bruce. The main style at the fair was Art Nouveau and Gray was a fan of the work of Charles Rennie Mackintosh which was on exhibit. Soon after, Gray moved to Paris along with her friends Gavin and Bruce from the Slade School. She continued her studies in Paris at the Académie Julian and the Académie Colarossi. In 1968, a complimentary magazine article drew attention to her accomplishments, and Gray agreed to production of her Bibendum chair and E-1027 table as well as numerous other pieces with Zeev Aram. They were soon to become modern furniture classics. On 8 November 1972, the Doucet sale added to the interest which continues to this day in the 'antiques' of the twentieth century. Gray's 'Le Destin' screen was featured in the sale and went for $36,000. Collectors entered the chase, and Yves Saint Laurent's interest completed the mythification of her image.
In February 2009, a "Dragons" armchair made by Gray between 1917-1919 (acquired by her early patron Suzanne Talbot and later part of the Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé collection) was sold at auction in Paris for 21.9 million euros (US$28.3 million), setting an auction record for 20th century decorative art.</p>

<p>The Bibendum chair was designed by Eileen Gray in the early 1900s but was largely forgotten until an original surfaced in a 1972 auction prompting a new production of this design classic. It is an opulent interpretation of the modernist aesthetic and firmly holds its own in the archives of great furniture design alongside the work of Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier who shunned Gray's artistic endeavours when alive. </p>

<a name="3D-Model-Decomposition" class="anchor" href="#3D-Model-Decomposition"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3D Model Decomposition</h2>

<p>The 3D model of this chair can be decomposed in two main parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leather seat with pillows</li>
<li>The metal frame</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="Pillows" class="anchor" href="#Pillows"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pillows</h3>

<p><img src="images/pillows.jpg" alt="pillows"></p>
<p>The leather set, can in turn be decomposed into two main parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The seat pillow</li>
<li>Two top pillows</li>
</ul>

<p>To represent these components, have been used mainly Bezier curves together with the half-torus and Bezier surfaces. The hardest part, was to make the outer covers of the seat pillow, so that would follow faithfully the inner profile. For the realization of covers, were used half-torus and Bezier surfaces.</p>

<p>Torus function used: </p>

<pre><code>var torus = function (R, r){
  return mapping = function (v) {
    var a = v[0]
    var b = v[1]

    var u = (r * COS(a) + R) * COS(b);
    var v = (r * COS(a) + R) * SIN(b);
    var w = (r * SIN(a));
    return [u,v,w];
  };
};
</code></pre>

<a name="The-metal-frame" class="anchor" href="#The-metal-frame"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The metal frame</h3>

<p><img src="images/frame.jpg" alt="frame"></p>


<p>The most difficult part in the realization of the metal structure, has been that of the inclined parts to coincide perfectly with those in plan, to do this was calculated the angle of inclination as faithful as possible to reality. Even in this case have been used half torus, Bezier curves and surfaces.</p>
